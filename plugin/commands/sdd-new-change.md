# /sdd-new-change

Start a new change with a typed specification and implementation plan, or create changes from an external specification.

## Usage

```
/sdd-new-change --type <feature|bugfix|refactor|epic> --name <change-name>
/sdd-new-change --spec <path-to-external-spec>
```

**Arguments:**
- `--type` (required without `--spec`): Type of change - `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, or `epic`
- `--name` (required without `--spec`): Name for the change (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- `--spec` (alternative mode): Path to an external specification file to import

**Examples:**
```bash
# New feature
/sdd-new-change --type feature --name user-authentication

# Bug fix
/sdd-new-change --type bugfix --name fix-session-timeout

# Refactor
/sdd-new-change --type refactor --name extract-validation-layer

# Epic (multiple features)
/sdd-new-change --type epic --name checkout-system

# From external spec (single or multiple changes)
/sdd-new-change --spec /path/to/external-spec.md
```

## Flow

**Permission Note**: This command creates 2-3 files (SPEC.md, PLAN.md, updates INDEX.md). If the user experiences many approval prompts, mention they can configure permissions per `plugin/hooks/PERMISSIONS.md`.

### 1. Parse Arguments (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)

**First, parse and validate the arguments:**

1. **If no arguments provided**, display usage and exit:
   ```
   Usage: /sdd-new-change --type <feature|bugfix|refactor|epic> --name <change-name>
          /sdd-new-change --spec <path-to-external-spec>

   Arguments:
     --type <type>  Type of change: feature, bugfix, refactor, or epic
     --name <name>  Name for the change directory
     --spec <path>  Path to external specification file

   Note: Either provide --type and --name, OR provide --spec (not both)

   Examples:
     /sdd-new-change --type feature --name user-authentication
     /sdd-new-change --type bugfix --name fix-login-timeout
     /sdd-new-change --spec /path/to/external-spec.md
   ```
   **Do not proceed without the required arguments.**

2. **Determine mode:**
   - If `--spec` is provided: Go to **External Spec Flow** (Step 1b)
   - If `--type` and `--name` are provided: Continue with **Interactive Flow** (Step 2+)
   - If neither: Show usage and exit

3. **For Interactive Flow - Validate arguments:**
   - **Validate `--type`:** Must be one of: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `epic`
   - **Validate `--name`:** Must be valid directory name (lowercase, hyphens allowed, no spaces)
   - If invalid, show error and requirements

**DO NOT proceed to Step 2 until arguments are validated.**

---

### 1b. External Spec Flow (if --spec provided)

**When `--spec` is provided, the command delegates to the external-spec-integration skill.**

1. **Validate spec path:**
   - Check that the path exists
   - If path is a file: Use that file directly
   - If path is a directory:
     - Look for entry point: `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `index.md`, `spec.md`
     - If no entry point, collect all `.md` files

2. **Extract outline** (chunked, no LLM needed):
   ```
   INVOKE spec-decomposition skill with:
     mode: "outline"
     spec_content: <file content or concatenated content>
     spec_is_directory: <true if directory>
     spec_files: <list of files if directory>
   ```
   Store: `spec_outline` (sections with line ranges and source file)

3. **Check git branch** (same as Step 2 for interactive flow):
   - If on `main`/`master`: Suggest creating a branch
   - Branch naming: `feature/import-<spec-filename>` or similar

4. **Get primary domain:**
   - Read from `sdd-settings.yaml` if available
   - Otherwise, ask the user: "Which domain should these changes belong to?"

5. **Invoke external-spec-integration skill:**
   ```yaml
   spec_path: <absolute path to external spec>
   spec_outline: <from step 2>
   target_dir: <current project root>
   primary_domain: <from sdd-settings.yaml or user>
   ```

   The skill:
   - Archives external spec to `archive/`
   - Presents outline to user for boundary level selection
   - Analyzes sections and decomposes into changes
   - Presents combined decomposition for user adjustment
   - Creates change specifications in `changes/`
   - Updates INDEX.md and glossary

6. **Display results:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    EXTERNAL SPEC IMPORTED
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Original spec archived to: archive/<spec-filename>

   CHANGES CREATED:

     - changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-1>/SPEC.md
     - changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-2>/SPEC.md
     ...

   NEXT STEPS:

     1. Review the generated change specs
     2. Run /sdd-implement-change to begin implementation
   ```

7. **Commit changes** using commit-standards format:
   ```
   Add <N> changes from external spec

   - Archived external spec to archive/
   - Created <N> change specs in changes/
   - Updated INDEX.md with new entries

   Co-Authored-By: SDD Plugin vX.Y.Z
   ```

**After External Spec Flow completes, the command is done. Do not proceed to Steps 2-6.**

---

### 2. Check Git Branch

**Now that we have the change info, check the branch:**

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch name
2. If the current branch is `main` or `master`:
   - **STOP immediately**
   - Inform the user: "You are currently on the `main`/`master` branch."
   - Suggest: "Would you like to create a branch first? Suggested branch name: `<type>/<change-name>`"
     - Use the actual type and change name from Step 1 (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/fix-timeout`)
   - Wait for user response:
     - If user says yes: Ask if they want to use the suggested name or provide their own
     - If user provides a branch name: Create the branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
     - If user says no: Warn them that they're about to create files on main/master, ask for explicit confirmation
3. If on any other branch: Proceed to Step 3

**DO NOT proceed to Step 3 until the branch situation is resolved.**

### 3. Collect Change Information

Prompt for additional details based on change type:

**For all types:**
- Issue reference (required)
- Domain (e.g., "Identity", "Billing", "Core")
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)

**Additional prompts by type:**

**For `feature`:**
- (No additional required prompts - user stories and acceptance criteria can be added in the spec)

**For `bugfix`:**
- "What are the symptoms of this bug?"
- "What is the expected behavior?"
- (Root cause can be documented later after investigation)

**For `refactor`:**
- "What are the main goals of this refactor?"
- "Which files/modules are primarily affected?"

**For `epic`:**
- "What is the overall goal of this epic?"
- "What child changes (features) should this epic contain?" (collect names and brief descriptions)
- "Are there dependencies between the child changes?"

### 4. Create Change Spec and Plan

Use the `change-creation` skill to create the change. Invoke the skill with:

```
name: <collected change name>
type: <collected type>
title: <change name formatted as title>
description: <collected description>
domain: <collected domain>
issue: <collected issue reference>

# For bugfix type:
root_cause: <to be determined during investigation>
affected_files: <if provided>

# For refactor type:
refactor_goals: <collected goals>
affected_files: <collected files/modules>
```

The `change-creation` skill will:
1. Create change directory: `changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/`
2. Create SPEC.md with proper frontmatter and type-specific sections
3. Create PLAN.md with type-appropriate phases
4. Update INDEX.md with the new change entry (includes type indicator)

See `skills/change-creation/SKILL.md` for detailed specification.

### 5. Review

- Show both spec and plan to user
- Wait for confirmation before proceeding
- If user requests changes, edit the files accordingly

### 6. Commit Change Spec

After user confirms the spec and plan are ready:

1. Stage the new files:
   ```bash
   git add changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/SPEC.md \
           changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/PLAN.md \
           INDEX.md
   ```

2. Commit using the commit-standards format:
   ```
   Add <change-name>: Create <type> spec and plan

   - Created SPEC.md with <type> specification
   - Created PLAN.md with implementation phases
   - Updated INDEX.md with change entry

   Co-Authored-By: SDD Plugin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. Confirm commit to user:
   ```
   ✓ Committed change spec: <commit-hash>

   Ready to implement! Run:
     /sdd-implement-change changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>
   ```

**If commit fails:** Display the error and ask the user how to proceed:
- "Commit failed: <error message>"
- Options: retry, skip commit (with data loss warning), or investigate

**Note:** If the user skips commit or declines, warn that uncommitted specs risk data loss.

## Important Notes

- **Two modes**: Interactive mode (`--type` + `--name`) or external spec mode (`--spec`)
- **Branch check is mandatory**: After validating arguments, the command checks the current git branch
- **Feature branches recommended**: Working on `main`/`master` is discouraged
- **Suggested naming**: `<type>/<change-name>` follows common git workflow conventions (epics use `epic/<name>`)
- **Epic flow**: For epics, after creating the parent spec/plan, child change directories are created under `changes/`
- **Type-specific templates**: Each change type gets appropriate spec sections and plan phases
- **User control**: Users can override the branch suggestion and proceed on main/master if they explicitly confirm
- **External spec flow**: When using `--spec`, change names and types are derived from spec analysis
