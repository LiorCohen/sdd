{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Getting Started

This project was scaffolded with SDD. To add your first feature:

```bash
/sdd-new-change --type feature --name <your-first-feature>
```

This will guide you through:
1. Creating a specification for your feature
2. Planning the implementation
3. Building it step by step

## Development

Once you have features implemented:

```bash
# Start local database (requires local Kubernetes cluster)
npm run database:setup
npm run database:port-forward

# Install dependencies and generate types
npm install
npm run generate

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```
