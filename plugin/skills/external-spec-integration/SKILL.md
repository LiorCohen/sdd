# External Spec Integration Skill

Processes external specification files into the SDD change structure, with optional multi-change decomposition.

## Purpose

When a user provides an external specification via `--spec`:
- Copy the external spec to the archive (`archive/`) for audit trail only
- Analyze the spec for potential decomposition into multiple changes
- Present decomposition options to user for adjustment
- Create **self-sufficient** change specifications that embed all relevant content
- Update shared files (INDEX.md, glossary)

**CRITICAL: External specs are consumed ONCE during import, then NEVER read again.**

Generated SPEC.md files must be completely self-sufficient. Implementation agents, planning skills, and any downstream processes must NEVER read from `archive/`. The archived external spec exists solely for audit/compliance purposes - it is not part of the working specification.

## When to Use

- During `/sdd-new-change --spec <path>` when external spec is provided
- For standalone spec import: `/sdd-import-spec <path>`

## Input

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `spec_path` | Yes | Absolute path to the external specification file |
| `spec_outline` | Yes | Pre-extracted outline from sdd-new-change Step 1b (sections with line ranges) |
| `target_dir` | Yes | Absolute path to the project directory |
| `primary_domain` | Yes | Primary domain for the project |

## Output

```yaml
success: true
external_spec_archived: "archive/original-spec.md"
is_epic: false  # true if created as epic structure
changes_created:
  - name: "user-authentication"
    path: "changes/2026/01/25/user-authentication/"
    spec_path: "changes/2026/01/25/user-authentication/SPEC.md"
    plan_path: "changes/2026/01/25/user-authentication/PLAN.md"
    type: "feature"
  - name: "password-reset"
    path: "changes/2026/01/25/password-reset/"
    spec_path: "changes/2026/01/25/password-reset/SPEC.md"
    plan_path: "changes/2026/01/25/password-reset/PLAN.md"
    type: "feature"
suggested_order: ["user-authentication", "password-reset"]
shared_concepts_added: ["User", "Session", "Token"]
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Copy External Spec to Archive

**Purpose:** Archive the original external specification for audit trail and traceability ONLY. This archived copy is for compliance/reference - implementers must use the generated SPEC.md files, not the external source.

**If spec is a single file:**
1. Determine the original filename from the spec path
2. Copy to: `archive/<original-filename>`
3. Store: `archived_spec_path = {target_dir}/archive/<filename>`
4. Display: "Archived external spec to: archive/<filename> (audit only - will not be read after import)"

**If spec is a directory:**
1. Determine the directory name from the spec path
2. Copy entire directory to: `archive/<directory-name>/`
3. Store: `archived_spec_dir = {target_dir}/archive/<directory-name>/`
4. Display: "Archived external spec directory to: archive/<directory-name>/ ({N} files) (audit only - will not be read after import)"

**Important:**
- All section reads during THIS import use the archived path, not the original `spec_path`
- After import completes, the archived spec is NEVER read again
- Generated SPEC.md files will embed the relevant content, making them self-sufficient

### Step 2: Present Outline to User

The `spec_outline` is already extracted (passed from sdd-new-change Step 1b). Present it to the user for confirmation.

**If `spec_outline.has_headers` is true:**

Display the structure with indentation based on header level.

**For single file:**
```
I found the following structure in this spec:

## User Authentication (lines 10-50)
   ### Login Flow (lines 15-30)
   ### Registration (lines 31-50)
## Dashboard (lines 51-120)
   ### Analytics (lines 55-80)
   ### Settings (lines 81-120)

I'll create a change for each H2 section.
Total: 2 changes (User Authentication, Dashboard)

Options:
  [A] Accept this breakdown
  [L] Use different level (H1 or H3 as change boundaries)
  [S] Single change (don't split)
  [C] Cancel
```

**For directory (multiple files):**
```
I found the following structure in this spec directory (3 files):

📄 README.md
   # Product Overview (lines 1-50)

📄 auth/authentication.md
   # User Authentication (lines 1-60)
      ## Login Flow (lines 10-40)
      ## Registration (lines 41-60)

📄 dashboard/overview.md
   # Dashboard (lines 1-80)
      ## Analytics (lines 20-50)
      ## Settings (lines 51-80)

I'll create a change for each H1 section (one per file's main topic).
Total: 3 changes (Product Overview, User Authentication, Dashboard)

Options:
  [A] Accept this breakdown
  [L] Use different level (H2 as change boundaries)
  [F] Use files as boundaries (one change per file)
  [S] Single change (don't split)
  [C] Cancel
```

**If `spec_outline.has_headers` is false:**

```
This spec has no markdown headers. I'll treat it as a single change.

Options:
  [A] Accept
  [C] Cancel
```

### Step 3: Handle User Level Choice

**If user chooses `[L]`**, ask which level to use:

```
Which header level should define change boundaries?
  [1] H1 headers (# Title)
  [2] H2 headers (## Title) - default
  [3] H3 headers (### Title)
```

Re-display the outline with the new boundary level highlighted.

**If user chooses `[F]` (directory specs only)**, use each file as a change boundary:
- One change per markdown file
- Use the file's first H1 header as the change name, or filename if no headers
- Re-display showing file-based grouping

### Step 4: Analyze Each Section

For each section at the chosen boundary level:

1. **Read section content** from the archived location:
   - **Single file:** Read from `archived_spec_path` using `start_line` to `end_line`
   - **Directory:** Read from `archived_spec_dir/<section.source_file>` using `start_line` to `end_line`

2. **Store the full section content:**
   ```yaml
   section_content: <complete markdown content of this section>
   ```
   This content will be embedded in the generated spec to make it self-sufficient.

3. **Analyze the section:**
   ```
   INVOKE spec-decomposition skill with:
     mode: "section"
     spec_content: <content of this section only>
     section_header: <e.g., "## User Authentication">
     default_domain: <primary_domain>
   ```

4. **Attach content to DecomposedChange:**
   Each `DecomposedChange` should include:
   ```yaml
   source_content: <full markdown content from the section>
   ```

5. **Collect** the `DecomposedChange` result with attached content

6. **Display progress:** "Analyzing: User Authentication (1/2)..."

### Step 5: Present Combined Decomposition

Combine all section analyses into a unified view:

```
Analysis complete. Here are the identified changes:

[c1] user-authentication (Identity) - feature - MEDIUM
     Login and session management
     Sections: "User Authentication"
     Endpoints: POST /auth/login, DELETE /auth/logout
     Dependencies: none

[c2] dashboard (Core) - feature - MEDIUM
     User dashboard with analytics
     Sections: "Dashboard"
     Endpoints: GET /dashboard, GET /analytics
     Dependencies: c1

Shared concepts (will be added to glossary):
  - User, Session, Analytics

Suggested implementation order: c1 → c2

Options:
  [A] Accept this breakdown
  [M] Merge changes (e.g., "merge c1 c2")
  [R] Rename a change (e.g., "rename c1 new-name")
  [T] Change type (e.g., "type c2 bugfix")
  [K] Keep as single spec (skip decomposition)
  [C] Cancel
```

### Step 5.5: Check for Epic Threshold

After user accepts the decomposition (before creating changes), check if an epic structure is needed:

**If total accepted changes >= 3:**

1. **Display epic recommendation:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📦 EPIC STRUCTURE RECOMMENDED
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   You have N changes identified. For 3+ changes, SDD recommends
   organizing them as an Epic for better tracking and organization.

   Epic structure:
     changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<epic-name>/
     ├── SPEC.md          (epic overview)
     ├── PLAN.md          (change ordering)
     └── changes/
         ├── 01-<change-1>/
         ├── 02-<change-2>/
         └── 03-<change-3>/

   Options:
     [E] Create as Epic (recommended)
     [I] Keep as individual changes
     [C] Cancel
   ```

2. **If user chooses [E]:**
   - Set `create_as_epic: true`
   - Generate epic name from domain or first change (e.g., `<domain>-implementation`)
   - Assign order-preserving prefixes to child changes: `01-`, `02-`, `03-`, etc.
   - Order reflects the dependency graph (topological sort from suggested_order)
   - Proceed to Step 7 with epic structure

3. **If user chooses [I]:**
   - Proceed with individual changes as before
   - Add note in summary: "Note: Large change set (N changes) created as individual changes"

**If total accepted changes < 3:**
- Skip this step, proceed directly to Step 6 and then Step 7

### Step 6: Handle User Adjustments

Process user adjustments in a loop:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **[A] Accept** | Check epic threshold (Step 5.5), then proceed to Step 7 |
| **[M] Merge** | Combine selected changes, re-display |
| **[R] Rename** | Update change name, re-display |
| **[T] Change type** | Update change type (feature/bugfix/refactor), re-display |
| **[K] Keep as single** | Create single change containing all content |
| **[C] Cancel** | Return with cancelled status |

Continue until user accepts or cancels.

### Step 7: Create Change Specifications

**If `create_as_epic` is true (3+ changes):**

1. Create the epic first:
   ```
   INVOKE change-creation skill with:
     name: <epic-name>
     type: epic
     title: <Epic Title>
     description: <combined description>
     domain: <primary_domain>
     issue: TBD
     child_changes: [01-change-1, 02-change-2, ...]
     acceptance_criteria: <combined ACs from all changes>
   ```

2. For each child change (with order-preserving prefix):
   ```
   INVOKE change-creation skill with:
     name: <NN-change-name>  # e.g., 01-user-authentication
     type: feature
     title: <Change Title>
     description: <extracted description>
     domain: <primary_domain or detected>
     issue: TBD
     user_stories: <extracted user stories>
     acceptance_criteria: <extracted ACs>
     api_endpoints: <extracted endpoints>
     source_content: <full section content from Step 4>
     external_source: ../../../archive/<filename>  # Audit reference only
     decomposition_id: <uuid>
     prerequisites: <prerequisite change names>
     parent_epic: ../SPEC.md
   ```

**If `create_as_epic` is false (individual changes):**

For each accepted change, invoke the `change-creation` skill:

```
INVOKE change-creation skill with:
  name: <change-name>
  type: <feature|bugfix|refactor>
  title: <Change Title>
  description: <extracted description>
  domain: <primary_domain or detected>
  issue: TBD
  user_stories: <extracted user stories>
  acceptance_criteria: <extracted ACs>
  api_endpoints: <extracted endpoints>
  source_content: <full section content from Step 4>
  external_source: ../../archive/<filename>  # Audit reference only
  decomposition_id: <uuid> (if multi-change)
  prerequisites: <prerequisite change names> (if dependencies)
```

**Verification (all cases):**

After each `change-creation` invocation, verify both files were created:
- [ ] SPEC.md exists at the returned `spec_path`
- [ ] PLAN.md exists at the returned `plan_path`

If either file is missing, report error and halt.

### Step 8: Update Shared Files

**Update INDEX.md with External Specifications table:**

```markdown
## External Specifications

| Source | Imported | Changes |
|--------|----------|---------|
| [<filename>](archive/<filename>) | YYYY-MM-DD | change-1, change-2, ... |
```

**Update domain glossary with shared concepts:**

Add extracted shared concepts from decomposition to `specs/domain/glossary.md`.

### Step 9: Return Summary

Display completion summary:

**For epic structure:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ EXTERNAL SPEC PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Change Decomposition

```
Input:
  spec_path: /tmp/user-management-spec.md
  target_dir: /home/dev/my-app
  primary_domain: "User Management"

[Spec contains: user registration, login, password reset, profile management]

Agent: I've identified 4 changes in this specification:

[c1] user-registration (User Management) - feature - MEDIUM

User: A

Output:
  success: true
  external_spec_archived: "archive/user-management-spec.md"
  changes_created:
    - {name: "user-registration", path: "changes/2026/01/25/user-registration/", type: "feature"}

  suggested_order: ["user-registration", "user-authentication", "password-reset", "profile-management"]
  shared_concepts_added: ["User", "Session", "Token", "Email"]
```

### Example 2: User Merges Changes

```
Agent: [displays 4 changes as above]

User: merge c3 c4

Agent: Merged "password-reset" and "profile-management" into "user-account-management".

[c1] user-registration - feature - MEDIUM
     ...

[c2] user-authentication - feature - MEDIUM
     ...

[c3] user-account-management - feature - MEDIUM
     Password reset and profile management
     Sections: "Password Reset", "Profile"
     Endpoints: POST /auth/reset, POST /auth/reset/confirm, GET /users/me, PATCH /users/me
     Dependencies: c2

Suggested order: c1 → c2 → c3

Options: [A] Accept [M] Merge [S] Split [R] Rename [T] Type [K] Keep single [C] Cancel

User: A
```

### Example 3: Keep as Single Spec

```
Agent: [displays 4 changes]

User: K

Agent: Keeping as single change. Creating unified change spec...

Output:
  success: true
  external_spec_archived: "archive/user-management-spec.md"
  changes_created:
    - {name: "user-management", path: "changes/2026/01/25/user-management/", type: "feature"}
  suggested_order: ["user-management"]
```

## Dependencies

This skill orchestrates:
- `spec-decomposition` - Analyzes spec for multi-change breakdown
- `change-creation` - Creates individual change directories

## Notes

- This skill is conversational and handles user interaction
- Archives the original external spec in `archive/` for audit/compliance only
- **CRITICAL:** External specs are consumed ONCE during import, then NEVER read again
- Generated SPEC.md files embed all relevant content and are completely self-sufficient
- Implementation agents must NEVER read from `archive/`
- Decomposition is optional - user can always keep as single spec
- Dependencies between changes are tracked and affect suggested order
- When 3+ changes are identified, epic structure is recommended for better organization
- Epic child changes use order-preserving prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.) to maintain implementation sequence
