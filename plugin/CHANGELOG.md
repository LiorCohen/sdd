# Changelog

## [1.6.2] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- **TypeScript standards compliance**: Corrected invalid `readonly interface` syntax across all plugin files
  - **typescript-standards skill**: Removed `readonly` keyword from interface declaration (line 40)
    - Changed from `readonly interface User {` (invalid TypeScript)
    - Changed to `interface User {` (correct - readonly applies to properties, not interface)
  - **backend-dev agent**: Fixed all 4 instances of `readonly interface`:
    - Line 54: `ServerDependencies` interface
    - Line 80: `Config` interface (in main Config layer example)
    - Line 213: `DAL` interface
    - Line 295: `Config` interface (in logging example)
  - **Validation**: Confirmed no other TypeScript standards violations (arrow functions, immutability, native JS)

### Updated Files

- `skills/typescript-standards.md`: Fixed interface syntax in immutability example
- `agents/backend-dev.md`: Fixed 4 instances of incorrect interface syntax
- Version bumped to 1.6.2 in plugin.json and marketplace.json

### Impact

This fix ensures all code examples in the plugin demonstrate correct TypeScript syntax:
- **Standards compliance**: All examples now follow valid TypeScript syntax
- **Educational accuracy**: Developers using the plugin will learn correct patterns
- **Code generation**: Agents will generate syntactically correct TypeScript code
- **Type checking**: Examples will pass TypeScript compiler validation

**Technical note**: TypeScript does not support `readonly` as a modifier for interface declarations. The `readonly` keyword only applies to interface properties, type properties, and array/object types (e.g., `ReadonlyArray<T>`, `Readonly<T>`).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **backend-dev agent**: Enforced dotenv usage and prohibited direct environment variable access
  - **Mandatory dotenv**: Config layer must use `dotenv.config()` at the top of src/config/index.ts
  - **Config layer ONLY**: `process.env` access is FORBIDDEN outside src/config/
  - **Type-safe configuration**: All layers receive typed Config object, never raw environment variables
  - **Updated Layer 2 (Config)**: Added comprehensive dotenv example with validation and error handling
  - **Updated telemetry/logging**: Logger must receive log level from Config, not process.env
  - **Dependency injection**: BaseLogger created from Config, passed down to all layers
  - Added 6 explicit environment variable rules
  - Added 3 new rules to Rules section

### Updated Files

- **backend-dev agent**:
  - Layer 2 (Config): Added dotenv.config() requirement and comprehensive example
  - Added "Environment Variable Rules" section with 6 rules
  - Updated "Structured Logging" section to use Config instead of process.env
  - Updated "Logging by Layer" section to show baseLogger dependency injection
  - Updated "Build Order" step 2 to emphasize dotenv usage
  - Updated "Rules" section with 3 new rules:
    - dotenv is mandatory
    - NO direct process.env access
    - Type-safe configuration only

### Impact

This enhancement improves configuration management and type safety:
- **Prevents scattered env access**: All environment variables centralized in Config layer
- **Type safety**: Config interface provides compile-time guarantees
- **Validation**: Required env vars validated at startup with clear error messages
- **Testability**: Config can be mocked/injected for testing
- **Security**: Clearer control over environment variable access
- **Best practices**: Follows 12-factor app configuration principles

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:implement-plan command**: Added mandatory domain documentation update phase
  - **New Step 2: Update Domain Documentation** - Required before any code implementation
  - Must update domain docs based on feature spec before writing code:
    1. **Glossary updates** (`specs/domain/glossary.md`): Add/update domain terms and concepts
    2. **Entity documentation** (`specs/domain/entities/`): Create/update entity spec files
    3. **Architecture documentation** (`specs/architecture/`): Update architectural patterns and integration points
  - Includes verification checklist to confirm all documentation areas are addressed
  - Explicitly requires noting when no updates are needed (prevents skipping)
  - Renumbered subsequent steps (Execute Phases → 3, Track Progress → 4, Final Verification → 5)

### Updated Files

- **implement-plan command**:
  - Added comprehensive "Step 2: Update Domain Documentation" with three sub-sections
  - Each sub-section includes specific tasks and verification requirements
  - Added verification checklist with 5 checkboxes
  - Added "Important Notes" section explaining why domain docs must come first
  - Updated example to show domain documentation update workflow
  - Renumbered existing steps (2 → 3, 3 → 4, 4 → 5)

### Impact

This enhancement ensures domain knowledge is properly documented:
- **Prevents implementation drift**: Code cannot be written until domain is documented
- **Centralized knowledge**: Glossary, entities, and architecture serve as single source of truth
- **Improved traceability**: Clear path from spec → domain docs → implementation
- **Better onboarding**: New team members can understand domain through centralized docs
- **Enforces best practices**: Domain-driven design principles built into workflow
- **No shortcuts**: Explicit verification prevents skipping documentation step

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:new-feature command**: Added git branch check and feature branch suggestion
  - **Step 0: Check Git Branch** - New mandatory first step before collecting any information
  - Automatically detects if user is on `main` or `master` branch
  - Suggests creating a feature branch with naming pattern `feature/<feature-name>`
  - Allows user to:
    - Accept suggested branch name (creates branch automatically)
    - Provide custom branch name
    - Decline and proceed on main/master (with warning and confirmation)
  - If already on a feature branch, proceeds without interruption
  - Follows git workflow best practices while maintaining user control

### Updated Files

- **new-feature command**:
  - Added Step 0: Check Git Branch (runs before collecting feature information)
  - Renumbered existing steps (Collect Info → 1, Create Spec → 2, Create Plan → 3, Review → 4)
  - Added "Important Notes" section explaining branch check behavior
  - Added three example interactions showing different scenarios:
    - Example 1: On main branch (creates feature branch)
    - Example 2: Already on feature branch (proceeds normally)
    - Example 3: On main branch (user declines, sees warning)

### Impact

This enhancement encourages proper git workflow:
- Prevents accidental feature creation directly on main/master
- Suggests consistent branch naming convention (`feature/<name>`)
- Educates users about best practices
- Maintains flexibility for users who need to work on main/master
- Reduces risk of merge conflicts and improves code review process

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Command renamed**: `/project:implement-spec` → `/project:implement-plan`
  - Better reflects that the command implements from a plan (which references a spec)
  - Command now takes path to PLAN.md instead of SPEC.md
  - Example: `/project:implement-plan specs/features/2026/01/11/user-auth/PLAN.md`

### Updated Files

- **implement-plan command** (renamed from implement-spec.md):
  - Updated command name, description, and usage examples
  - Changed to read PLAN.md first, then SPEC.md from same directory
  - Updated flow documentation to reflect plan-centric approach
- **Documentation files**: Updated all references to use new command name
  - CLAUDE.md
  - plugin/README.md
  - plugin/QUICKSTART.md
  - plugin/templates/project/README.md
  - plugin/templates/project/CLAUDE.md

### Impact

This change clarifies the implementation workflow:
- Plans are the execution documents, specs are the requirements
- Command name now matches what it operates on (plan, not spec)
- Consistent with the pattern where plan references spec via `./SPEC.md`
- More intuitive for users: "implement the plan" vs "implement the spec"

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Directory structure**: Features now use date-based organization
  - Feature specs: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` (was: `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`)
  - Implementation plans: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` (was: `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`)
  - Plans now live alongside their specs in the same directory
  - Removed separate `specs/plans/` directory

### Updated Files

- **spec-writer agent**: Updated location rules with date-based feature paths
- **planner agent**: Plans now stored alongside specs (not in separate plans/ directory)
- **planning skill**: Updated plan location and template
- **spec-writing skill**: Updated spec locations table with date-based organization
- **new-feature command**: Creates dated feature directories and sets creation date
- **init-project command**: Removed `specs/plans/` from directory structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated examples and Important Files table

### Impact

This change provides better organization and traceability:
- Chronological organization of features by creation date
- Specs and plans kept together in one location
- Easier to find features by when they were created
- Cleaner directory structure (no separate plans directory)
- Relative paths in plans (./SPEC.md) instead of absolute paths

### Migration Guide

For existing projects using the old structure:
- Move `specs/features/<feature-name>/SPEC.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/SPEC.md`
- Move `specs/plans/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md` to `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`
- Use the `created` date from the spec frontmatter for the YYYY/MM/DD directory
- Delete empty `specs/plans/` directory

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **/project:init-project command**: Completely redesigned with approval-based workflow
  - **Phase 1: Gather Information** - Prompts for project details before any file creation
    - Project name and description
    - Primary business domain
    - Tech stack confirmation
    - Component selection (Server, Webapp, Helm, Testing, CI/CD)
  - **Phase 2: Show Configuration Summary** - Displays complete plan with directory structure
  - **Phase 3: User Approval** - Explicitly asks for confirmation before creating any files
  - **Phase 4: Project Creation** - Only executes after user approval
  - Customizable component selection (choose which parts to include)
  - Template variable substitution for project name, description, and domain
  - Conditional directory/file creation based on selected components
  - More predictable and transparent initialization process

### Impact

This update transforms /project:init-project from an automatic file generator into an interactive, approval-based tool:
- No files created until user explicitly approves
- Users can customize which components to include
- Clear visibility into what will be created before it happens
- Follows same approval pattern as spec-writer and planner agents
- Better user experience with informed decision-making

- Centralized TypeScript standards in one location
- Centralized Testkube documentation in testing skill
- Improved consistency between backend and frontend development

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added strict version management workflow
  - Enforces required sequence: code changes → version bump → CHANGELOG update → commit
  - Prevents version bumps without corresponding CHANGELOG entries
  - Includes example workflow for clarity
  - Makes version management process explicit and mandatory

This ensures all version changes are properly documented before being committed.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-11

### Enhanced
