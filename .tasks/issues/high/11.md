# Task 11: Missing deeper config integration

## Description

Configuration system needs deeper integration.

## Implementation Summary

Implemented a complete config component architecture with:
- Config scaffolding skill with templates for envs/, schemas/, and types/
- Backend templates updated to use YAML config instead of dotenv
- Config is now a mandatory singleton component at components/config/
- Helm standards and scaffolding skills for Kubernetes deployment
- /sdd-config command for generate, validate, diff, and add-env operations
- sdd-system CLI config namespace with generate, validate, diff, add-env commands
- Config standards skill documenting best practices
- Component-recommendation skill updated to include config as mandatory first component
- Comprehensive documentation including config-guide.md
- 139+ tests covering all config-related functionality (including 59 functional CLI tests)
