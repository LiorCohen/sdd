# Task 63: Consolidate overlapping skills

## Description

The plugin has accumulated many skills with significant overlap and redundancy. This creates confusion about which skill to use, increases maintenance burden, and dilutes the guidance each skill provides.

Need to audit all skills, identify overlapping functionality, and consolidate into fewer, more focused skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all skills in `plugin/skills/` for overlap
- [ ] Identify skills that can be merged or eliminated
- [ ] Consolidate redundant skills while preserving essential guidance
- [ ] Update any references to consolidated skills (commands, agents, docs)
- [ ] Ensure no guidance is lost during consolidation
- [ ] Document the rationale for each consolidation decision
