## Why Split?

The original `CHANGELOG.md` exceeded Claude's maximum file size limit (~25,000 tokens). Splitting by major version keeps each file readable while preserving the full history.

## Structure

- **Root `CHANGELOG.md`** - Index with version table + latest entries (for quick access)
- **`changelog/v{N}.md`** - Complete history for each major version

## Adding New Entries

When committing changes, update **both** files:

1. Add entry to the appropriate version file (e.g., `changelog/v5.md` for version 5.x.x)
2. Add the same entry to root `CHANGELOG.md` after the version history table

See the [commit skill](../.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md) for detailed guidance.
