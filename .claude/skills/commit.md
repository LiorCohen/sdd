# /commit

Create a commit that follows the repository's CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.

## Flow

### 1. Read CONTRIBUTING.md

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root to understand:
- Commit message format
- Co-author requirements
- Version bumping rules
- Changelog requirements
- File grouping rules

### 2. Analyze Changes

Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand:
- Which files have been modified
- Which plugins are affected
- Whether version files need updating
- Whether CHANGELOG needs updating

### 3. Version Check

For each affected plugin:
- Check `plugin.json` version
- Check `marketplace.json` version
- If versions don't match the changes, prompt for version bump:
  - **PATCH** (x.x.X): Bug fixes, small improvements
  - **MINOR** (x.X.0): New features, backwards compatible
  - **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes

### 4. Changelog Check

For each affected plugin:
- Check if CHANGELOG.md has entry for the new version
- If not, create one based on staged changes
- Format: `## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD` with categorized changes

### 5. Generate Commit Message

Based on CONTRIBUTING.md format:

```
[Action] [Component]: [Description], bump to [version]

[Optional detailed explanation]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Actions:
- **Add**: New feature or file
- **Fix**: Bug fix
- **Update**: Enhancement to existing feature
- **Remove**: Deletion
- **Refactor**: Code restructuring without behavior change
- **Docs**: Documentation only

### 6. Review and Confirm

Present to the user:
- Summary of files to be committed
- Proposed commit message
- Version changes (if any)
- Changelog additions (if any)

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### 7. Execute Commit

After confirmation:
1. Stage any additional files (version files, CHANGELOG)
2. Create the commit with the generated message
3. Display commit result

- Include Co-Authored-By attribution
- Commit related changes together (code + version + changelog)
- Both plugin.json AND marketplace.json versions must be updated
