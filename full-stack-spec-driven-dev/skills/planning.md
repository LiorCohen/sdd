# Planning Skill

## Plan Location

Plans are stored alongside their specs:

`specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/<feature-name>/PLAN.md`

This keeps all feature documentation (spec + plan) together in one location.

## Phase Sizing

- 1-2 days of work per phase
- Each phase independently deployable
- Contract changes come first
