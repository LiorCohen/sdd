# /sdd-generate-snapshot

Regenerate product snapshot.

## Usage

```
/sdd-generate-snapshot
```

## Flow

### 1. Find Active Specs

- Scan `specs/changes/` for all SPEC.md files
- Filter for `status: active`
- Group by domain

### 2. Generate INDEX.md

Update the spec registry with:
- Total count of specs
- Breakdown by status (active, deprecated, archived)
- Table of all specs with:
  - Change name
  - Type (feature, bugfix, refactor)
  - Path to spec
  - Domain
  - Issue reference
  - Creation date

### 3. Generate SNAPSHOT.md

Compile current product state:
- Organize by domain
- For each active change:
  - Change name
  - Link to spec
  - Issue reference
  - Summary of capabilities
  - Key endpoints (from API Contract section)
- Generate table of contents

### 4. Report

```
✓ Generated specs/INDEX.md
  - Total: 15 specs
  - Active: 12
  - Deprecated: 2
  - Archived: 1

✓ Generated specs/SNAPSHOT.md
  - Domains: Identity, Billing, Core
  - Changes: 12

Next steps:
1. Review specs/SNAPSHOT.md
2. Commit changes: git add specs/ && git commit -m "Update snapshot"
```

## When to Use

- After merging a new spec
- After deprecating/archiving a spec
- Before a release (to document current state)
- Periodically to keep documentation fresh

## Implementation

Uses `scripts/generate-index.py` and `scripts/generate-snapshot.py`
