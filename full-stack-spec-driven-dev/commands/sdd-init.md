# /sdd-init

Initialize a new spec-driven project, optionally from an existing external specification.

## Usage

```
/sdd-init [--name project-name] [--spec <path-to-external-spec>]
```

**Arguments:**
- `--name <project-name>` (optional): Name of the project directory to create
- `--spec <path>` (optional): Path to an external specification file to use as the initial spec

**Examples:**
```bash
# Standard initialization with prompts
/sdd-init --name my-app

# Initialize from existing spec
/sdd-init --name my-app --spec /path/to/existing-spec.md

# Initialize from external spec (will prompt for project name)
/sdd-init --spec /path/to/product-requirements.md
```

## Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This command follows an approval-based workflow. Do NOT create any files or directories until the user has approved the project configuration.

### Phase 0: Parse Arguments and Load External Spec (if provided)

1. **Parse command arguments:**
   - Check if `--spec <path>` argument is provided
   - Extract project name (if provided)
   - Extract spec path (if provided)

2. **If external spec is provided:**
   - Read the external spec file from the provided path
   - Parse the spec to extract:
     - **Project Name**: Look for title/project name in spec
     - **Description**: Look for description or summary
     - **Domain**: Identify primary business domain from content
     - **Key Definitions**: Extract main definitions/concepts mentioned
     - **Requirements**: Parse functional and non-functional requirements
   - Store this information for use in later phases
   - Display: "✓ Loaded external spec from: <path>"

3. **Validation:**
   - If spec file doesn't exist, show error and exit
   - If spec file is not readable, show error and exit
   - If spec is empty or invalid, show warning and ask if user wants to continue with standard initialization

### Phase 1: Gather Information

When invoked, prompt the user for the following information (use extracted values from external spec as defaults if available):

1. **Project Name and Directory Check** (if not provided as argument)
   - If external spec provided: Use extracted project name as default
   - Must be valid directory name (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
   - Prompt: "Project name [<default-if-any>]: "
   - Example: "my-saas-app"

   **CRITICAL: Check for existing directory match:**
   - Get the current working directory basename (e.g., if pwd is `/path/to/my-app`, basename is `my-app`)
   - If the current directory basename matches the project name:
     - Check if the directory is empty (no files except hidden files like .git, .DS_Store)
     - If empty: Ask user "You're already in an empty directory named '<project-name>'. Initialize here? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Set target directory to current directory (`.`)
     - If no: Ask for a different project name
     - If directory is not empty: Show warning "Current directory is not empty. Will create subdirectory '<project-name>/' instead."
   - If basename doesn't match: Will create new subdirectory `<project-name>/`

2. **Project Description**
   - If external spec provided: Use extracted description as default
   - Brief one-line description of what this application does
   - Will be used in README.md and package.json
   - Prompt: "Project description [<default-if-any>]: "
   - Example: "A task management SaaS application"

3. **Primary Domain**
   - If external spec provided: Use extracted domain as default
   - What is the main business domain?
   - Will be added to initial glossary
   - Prompt: "Primary domain [<default-if-any>]: "
   - Example: "Task Management" or "E-commerce" or "Healthcare"

4. **Initial Components**
   - Ask which project type to create:

   **Option A: Full-Stack Application** (Recommended)
   - Contract (OpenAPI spec)
   - Server (Node.js backend)
   - Webapp (React frontend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option B: Backend API Only**
   - Contract (OpenAPI spec)
   - Server (Node.js backend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option C: Frontend Only** (requires external API)
   - Webapp (React frontend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option D: Custom** (manual selection with dependency validation)

   **Component Dependencies:**
   | Component | Requires | Notes |
   |-----------|----------|-------|
   | Contract | Server | OpenAPI spec needs a backend to implement it |
   | Server | Contract | Backend requires API contract |
   | Webapp | - | Can work standalone with external API |
   | Config | - | Always required for all project types |
   | Helm | Server | Kubernetes deployment is for backend services |
   | Testing | Server or Webapp | Tests need something to test |
   | CI/CD | Server or Webapp | Workflows need something to build/test |

   **Validation Rules:**
   - Config is always auto-included (required for all project types)
   - If Server is selected, Contract is auto-included
   - If Helm is selected, Server must be included (Helm is for backend deployment)
   - If Contract is selected without Server, warn and ask for confirmation

### Phase 2: Show Configuration Summary

Display a summary of what will be created:

```markdown
## Project Configuration Summary

**Name:** <project-name>
**Location:** <current-directory> OR <current-directory>/<project-name>/
**Description:** <description>
**Primary Domain:** <domain>

**Project Type:** <Full-Stack | Backend API | Frontend | Custom>

**Components to create:**
- ✓ Contract (OpenAPI spec)
- ✓ Server (Node.js backend)
- ✓ Webapp (React frontend)
- ✓ Config (YAML configuration)
- ✓ Helm charts (if selected)
- ✓ Testing setup
- ✓ CI/CD workflows

**Directory Structure:**

└── .github/               # CI/CD workflows (if selected)

**Files to create:** ~XX files
```

### Phase 3: User Approval

**CRITICAL:** Ask the user explicitly:
```
Do you want to proceed with creating this project structure? (yes/no)
```

**DO NOT create any files until the user confirms with "yes" or equivalent.**

If the user says no, ask what they'd like to change and return to Phase 1.

### Phase 4: Project Creation (Only After Approval)

Once approved, use the `scaffold` skill to create the project structure quickly.

**IMPORTANT:** Use the Python scaffold script instead of creating files one by one. This reduces creation time from ~5 minutes to ~5 seconds.

### Step 1: Determine paths

1. **Find the plugin directory:**
   - The plugin is loaded via `--add-dir`, so look for the `templates/` directory
   - Use: `PLUGIN_DIR=$(dirname $(find . -path "*sdd*/templates" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1) 2>/dev/null || echo "")`
   - If not found locally, check common plugin locations or use the Glob tool to find `**/full-stack-spec-driven-dev/templates`

2. **Determine target directory:**
   - If initializing in current directory: `TARGET_DIR="$(pwd)"`
   - If creating subdirectory: `TARGET_DIR="$(pwd)/<project-name>"`

### Step 2: Map components to scaffold format

Convert the selected project type to component list:

| Project Type | Components |
|--------------|------------|
| Full-Stack Application | `["contract", "server", "webapp", "config", "testing", "cicd"]` |
| Backend API Only | `["contract", "server", "config", "testing", "cicd"]` |
| Frontend Only | `["webapp", "config", "testing", "cicd"]` |
| Custom | User's selection + "config" (always included) |

### Step 3: Run the scaffold script

```bash
# Create config file
cat > /tmp/sdd-scaffold-config.json << 'EOF'
{
    "project_name": "<PROJECT_NAME>",
    "project_description": "<PROJECT_DESCRIPTION>",
    "primary_domain": "<PRIMARY_DOMAIN>",
    "target_dir": "<TARGET_DIR>",
    "components": [<COMPONENT_LIST>],
    "template_dir": "<PLUGIN_DIR>/templates"
}
EOF

# Run scaffold
python3 <PLUGIN_DIR>/skills/scaffold/scaffold.py --config /tmp/sdd-scaffold-config.json

# Clean up
rm /tmp/sdd-scaffold-config.json
```

Replace the placeholders with actual values from Phase 1.

### Step 4: External spec integration (if provided)

If an external spec was provided via `--spec` argument:

1. **Copy external spec to specs/external/:**
   - Determine the original filename from the external spec path
   - Copy external spec to: `specs/external/<original-filename>`
   - This preserves the original external spec in the repository for reference
   - Display: "✓ Copied external spec to: specs/external/<original-filename>"

2. **Create initial feature spec from external spec:**
   - Generate today's date path: `YYYY/MM/DD`
   - Create feature directory: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/`
   - Copy external spec to: `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md`
   - Add frontmatter to the spec if not present:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: Initial Specification (from external source)
     status: active
     domain: {{PRIMARY_DOMAIN}}
     issue: TBD
     created: YYYY-MM-DD
     updated: YYYY-MM-DD
     sdd_version: {{SDD_VERSION}}
     external_source: ../../external/<original-filename>
     ---
     ```
   - Note: `{{SDD_VERSION}}` is read from this plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - Add a reference section at the top of the spec content:
     ```markdown
     ## External Source

     This specification was imported from an external document: `../../external/<original-filename>`

     Original path: `{{EXTERNAL_SPEC_PATH}}`
     Imported on: YYYY-MM-DD
     ```
   - Preserve all original content from external spec below the reference section

3. **Update INDEX.md:**
   - Add entry for the initial spec:
     ```markdown
     ## Active Specifications

     - [Initial Specification](features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md) - Imported from external source
     ```
   - Add entry for the external spec:
     ```markdown
     ## External Specifications

     - [<original-filename>](external/<original-filename>) - Original external specification imported on YYYY-MM-DD
     ```

4. **Update SNAPSHOT.md:**
   - Add initial feature summary based on external spec content
   - Extract key capabilities and list them

5. **Update domain glossary:**
   - Extract key terms from external spec
   - Add them to `specs/domain/glossary.md` with definitions

6. **Create initial plan:**
   - Generate `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md`
   - Break down external spec requirements into implementation phases
   - Use the `planner` agent pattern for structure

7. **Display confirmation:**
   ```
   ✓ External spec copied to: specs/external/<original-filename>
   ✓ External spec integrated as initial feature specification
   ✓ Location: specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md
   ✓ Generated initial plan: specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md
   ✓ Updated INDEX.md and SNAPSHOT.md
   ✓ Extracted domain terms to glossary

   Next step: Review the generated plan and run /sdd-implement-plan specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md
   ```

### Step 5: Initialize git repository

If not already in a git repository:
```bash
cd ${TARGET_DIR} && git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup from spec-driven template"
```

If already in a git repository (current directory case):
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup from spec-driven template"
```

### Step 6: Verify completion and report

After ALL steps are done:

1. List the created structure:
   ```bash
   tree ${TARGET_DIR} -L 3 -I node_modules
   ```

2. Display completion message with customized next steps:

   **If external spec was provided:**
   ```
   ✓ Project initialized: <project-name>
   ✓ Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
   ✓ Description: <project-description>
   ✓ Primary Domain: <primary-domain>
   ✓ Components created: <list of selected components>
   ✓ External spec copied to: specs/external/<original-filename>
   ✓ External spec integrated: specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md

   Next steps:
   [If TARGET_DIR is not current directory]
   1. cd <project-name>
   2. npm install --workspaces
   [If TARGET_DIR is current directory]
   1. npm install --workspaces
   3. Review the imported spec and generated plan:
      - specs/external/<original-filename> (original external spec, preserved for reference)
      - specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md (imported with SDD frontmatter)
      - specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md (generated implementation plan)
      - specs/domain/glossary.md (extracted domain terms)
   4. When ready to implement:
      /sdd-implement-plan specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/PLAN.md
   ```

   **If standard initialization (no external spec):**
   ```
   ✓ Project initialized: <project-name>
   ✓ Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
   ✓ Description: <project-description>
   ✓ Primary Domain: <primary-domain>
   ✓ Components created: <list of selected components>

   Next steps:
   [If TARGET_DIR is not current directory]
   1. cd <project-name>
   2. npm install --workspaces
   [If TARGET_DIR is current directory]
   1. npm install --workspaces
   3. cd components/contract && npm run generate:types
   4. Review and customize:
      - specs/domain/glossary.md (add your domain terms)
      - components/contract/openapi.yaml (define your first API)
   5. Create your first feature: /sdd-new-feature <feature-name>
   ```

**DO NOT STOP until you have completed every single step above and verified the structure.**

## Important Notes

- This command will ALWAYS ask for user approval before creating files
- Users can customize which components to include
- All template variables are populated from user-provided information
- Project structure is created atomically (all or nothing)
- **External spec support**: When `--spec` is provided, the external spec is:
  - Copied to `specs/external/<original-filename>` for permanent reference
  - Parsed to extract defaults for project setup
  - Integrated as the initial feature specification in `specs/features/YYYY/MM/DD/initial-spec/SPEC.md`
  - Referenced in the feature spec via `external_source` frontmatter field
  - Used to generate an implementation plan
  - Processed to extract domain terms for the glossary
  - This allows seamless initialization from existing product requirements, design documents, or specifications while preserving the original source

## Template Sources

All template files are in the `templates/` directory of this plugin:
- `templates/project/` - Root project files
- `templates/components/` - Component scaffolding
- `templates/specs/` - Initial spec structure
- `templates/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows
