# /sdd-init

Initialize a new spec-driven project, optionally from an existing external specification.

## Usage

```
/sdd-init --name <project-name> [--spec <path-to-external-spec>]
```

**Arguments:**
- `--name <project-name>` (required): Name of the project directory to create
- `--spec <path>` (optional): Path to an external specification file to use as the initial spec

**Examples:**
```bash
# Standard initialization
/sdd-init --name my-app

# Initialize from existing spec
/sdd-init --name my-app --spec /path/to/existing-spec.md
```

## Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This command follows an approval-based workflow. Do NOT create any files or directories until the user has approved the project configuration.

### Phase 0: Parse Arguments

1. **If no arguments provided**, display usage and exit:
   ```
   Usage: /sdd-init --name <project-name> [--spec <path>]

   Arguments:
     --name <project-name>  Name of the project directory to create (required)
     --spec <path>          Path to external specification file (optional)

   Examples:
     /sdd-init --name my-app
     /sdd-init --name my-app --spec /path/to/spec.md
   ```
   **Do not proceed to Phase 1 without at least `--name`.**

2. **Parse command arguments:**
   - Check if `--spec <path>` argument is provided
   - Extract project name (required)
   - Extract spec path (if provided)

2. **If external spec is provided:**
   - Read the external spec file from the provided path
   - Parse the spec to extract:
     - **Project Name**: Look for title/project name in spec
     - **Description**: Look for description or summary
     - **Domain**: Identify primary business domain from content
     - **Key Definitions**: Extract main definitions/concepts mentioned
     - **Requirements**: Parse functional and non-functional requirements
   - Store this information for use in later phases
   - Display: "✓ Loaded external spec from: <path>"

3. **Validation:**
   - If spec file doesn't exist, show error and exit
   - If spec file is not readable, show error and exit
   - If spec is empty or invalid, show warning and ask if user wants to continue with standard initialization

### Phase 1: Gather Information

Prompt the user for the following information (use extracted values from external spec as defaults if available):

1. **Directory Check** (using `--name` from arguments)
   - Validate project name is a valid directory name (lowercase, hyphens allowed)

   **Check for existing directory match:**
   - Get the current working directory basename (e.g., if pwd is `/path/to/my-app`, basename is `my-app`)
   - If the current directory basename matches the project name:
     - Check if the directory is empty (no files except hidden files like .git, .DS_Store)
     - If empty: Ask user "You're already in an empty directory named '<project-name>'. Initialize here? (yes/no)"
     - If yes: Set target directory to current directory (`.`)
     - If no: Ask for a different project name
     - If directory is not empty: Show warning "Current directory is not empty. Will create subdirectory '<project-name>/' instead."
   - If basename doesn't match: Will create new subdirectory `<project-name>/`
   - If no: Show error and exit

2. **Project Description**
   - If external spec provided: Use extracted description as default
   - Brief one-line description of what this application does
   - Will be used in README.md and package.json
   - Prompt: "Project description [<default-if-any>]: "
   - Example: "A task management SaaS application"

3. **Primary Domain**
   - If external spec provided: Use extracted domain as default
   - What is the main business domain?
   - Will be added to initial glossary
   - Prompt: "Primary domain [<default-if-any>]: "
   - Example: "Task Management" or "E-commerce" or "Healthcare"

4. **Initial Components**
   - Ask which project type to create:

   **Option A: Full-Stack Application** (Recommended)
   - Contract (OpenAPI spec)
   - Server (Node.js backend)
   - Webapp (React frontend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option B: Backend API Only**
   - Contract (OpenAPI spec)
   - Server (Node.js backend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option C: Frontend Only** (requires external API)
   - Webapp (React frontend)
   - Config (YAML configuration)
   - Testing (Testkube setup)
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

   **Option D: Custom** (manual selection with dependency validation)

   **Component Dependencies:**
   | Component | Requires | Notes |
   |-----------|----------|-------|
   | Contract | Server | OpenAPI spec needs a backend to implement it |
   | Server | Contract | Backend requires API contract |
   | Webapp | - | Can work standalone with external API |
   | Config | - | Always required for all project types |
   | Helm | Server | Kubernetes deployment is for backend services |
   | Testing | Server or Webapp | Tests need something to test |
   | CI/CD | Server or Webapp | Workflows need something to build/test |

   **Validation Rules:**
   - Config is always auto-included (required for all project types)
   - If Server is selected, Contract is auto-included
   - If Helm is selected, Server must be included (Helm is for backend deployment)
   - If Contract is selected without Server, warn and ask for confirmation

5. **Multiple Component Instances** (Optional, for Custom projects)

   If user selects Custom or requests multiple backends/frontends:

   **For Server components:**
   - Ask: "How many server components do you need? (1-5)"
   - If > 1, for each: "Name for server component N (e.g., 'api', 'worker', 'scheduler'):"
   - Creates: `components/server-api/`, `components/server-worker/`, etc.

   **For Webapp components:**
   - Ask: "How many webapp components do you need? (1-5)"
   - If > 1, for each: "Name for webapp component N (e.g., 'admin', 'public', 'dashboard'):"
   - Creates: `components/webapp-admin/`, `components/webapp-public/`, etc.

   **Naming Rules:**
   - Names must be lowercase
   - Use hyphens, not underscores
   - No spaces allowed
   - Examples: `api`, `worker`, `admin`, `public`, `background-jobs`

   **Component Format in Config:**
   - Single instance: `"server"` → `components/server/`
   - Named instance: `"server:api"` → `components/server-api/`

### Phase 2: Show Configuration Summary

Display a summary of what will be created:

```markdown
## Project Configuration Summary

**Name:** <project-name>
**Location:** <current-directory> OR <current-directory>/<project-name>/
**Description:** <description>
**Primary Domain:** <domain>

**Project Type:** <Full-Stack | Backend API | Frontend | Custom>

**Components to create:**
- ✓ Contract (OpenAPI spec)
- ✓ Server (Node.js backend)
- ✓ Webapp (React frontend)
- ✓ Config (YAML configuration)
- ✓ Helm charts (if selected)
- ✓ Testing setup
- ✓ CI/CD workflows

└── .github/               # CI/CD workflows (if selected)

**Files to create:** ~XX files
```

### Phase 3: User Approval

**CRITICAL:** Ask the user explicitly:
```
Do you want to proceed with creating this project structure? (yes/no)
```

**DO NOT create any files until the user confirms with "yes" or equivalent.**

If the user says no, ask what they'd like to change and return to Phase 1.

### Phase 4: Project Creation (Only After Approval)

#### Step 4.1: Create Project Settings

First, use the `project-settings` skill to create `sdd-settings.yaml` with the project configuration.

**Use the `project-settings` skill with operation `create`:**

```
Input:
  plugin_version: <read from plugin's .claude-plugin/plugin.json>
  project_name: <from Phase 1>
  project_description: <from Phase 1>
  project_domain: <from Phase 1>
  project_type: <"fullstack" | "backend" | "frontend" | "custom" based on selected option>
  components:
    contract: <true if selected>
    server: <true if selected>
    webapp: <true if selected>
    config: <true if selected>
    helm: <true if selected>
    testing: <true if selected>
    cicd: <true if selected>
```

This creates `sdd-settings.yaml` in the project root, which persists the project configuration for use by other commands and workflows.

#### Step 4.2: Scaffold Project Structure

Use the `scaffolding` skill to create the project structure.

**See the `scaffolding` skill for detailed instructions.** Pass the following from Phase 1:
- `project_name`, `project_description`, `primary_domain`
- `target_dir`: Current directory or subdirectory based on Phase 1 directory check
- `components`: Based on selected project type (Full-Stack, Backend API, Frontend, or Custom)

### Step 5: External spec integration (if provided)

If an external spec was provided via `--spec` argument:

#### Step 5.1: Copy external spec to archive

1. Determine the original filename from the external spec path
2. Copy external spec to: `specs/external/<original-filename>`
3. This preserves the original external spec in the repository for reference
4. Display: "✓ Copied external spec to: specs/external/<original-filename>"

#### Step 5.2: Analyze spec for change decomposition

Use the `spec-decomposition` skill to analyze the external spec:

```
Input:
  spec_content: <content of the external spec>
  spec_path: <original path to external spec>
  default_domain: {{PRIMARY_DOMAIN}}
```

The skill returns a `DecompositionResult` with:
- `is_decomposable`: whether the spec can be split into multiple changes
- `changes`: list of identified changes with their metadata
- `shared_concepts`: domain concepts used across changes
- `suggested_order`: recommended implementation sequence
- `warnings`: any issues detected (circular deps, large changes, etc.)

See `skills/spec-decomposition/SKILL.md` for the full algorithm and data structures.

**If `is_decomposable` is false:**
- Display any warnings from the result
- Display: "This spec will be implemented as a single change."
- Skip to Step 5.4 with single change from the result

#### Step 5.3: Present decomposition and get user approval

**If `is_decomposable` is true**, present the decomposition result to the user:

1. **Display any warnings** from the result (circular dependencies, large changes, etc.)

2. **Display the proposed change breakdown** using data from the result:

```
I've identified N changes in this specification:

[c1] change-name (Domain) - feature - COMPLEXITY
     Brief description (1 line)
     Sections: "Section A", "Section B"
     Endpoints: METHOD /path, METHOD /path
     Dependencies: none

[c2] another-change (Domain) - feature - COMPLEXITY
     Brief description
     Sections: "Section C"
     Endpoints: METHOD /path
     Dependencies: c1

...

Shared concepts (will be added to domain glossary):
  - Concept1, Concept2, Concept3

Suggested implementation order: c1 → c2 → c3 → ...

Options:
  [A] Accept this breakdown
  [M] Merge changes (e.g., "merge c2 c3")
  [S] Split a change (e.g., "split c4")
  [R] Rename a change (e.g., "rename c1 new-name")
  [T] Change type (e.g., "type c2 bugfix")
  [K] Keep as single spec (skip decomposition)
  [C] Cancel
```

3. **Handle user adjustments in a loop:**

- **[A] Accept**: Proceed to Step 5.4 with the accepted changes
- **[M] Merge**: Use the merge operation from spec-decomposition skill, re-display result
- **[S] Split**: Ask for split criteria, use split operation from skill, re-display result
- **[R] Rename**: Use rename operation from skill, re-display result
- **[T] Change type**: Update the change type (feature/bugfix/refactor), re-display result
- **[K] Keep as single**: Proceed to Step 5.4 with single change containing all content
- **[C] Cancel**: Display "Initialization cancelled." and exit

Continue the adjustment loop until user accepts or cancels.

#### Step 5.4: Create change specifications

Use the `change-creation` skill to create each change. For each accepted change (or single change if [K] was chosen), invoke the skill with:

```
name: <change-name>
type: <feature|bugfix|refactor>  # Default: feature for decomposed specs
title: <Change Title>
description: <extracted description>
domain: {{PRIMARY_DOMAIN}} or detected domain
issue: TBD
user_stories: <extracted user stories for this change>
acceptance_criteria: <extracted ACs for this change>
api_endpoints: <extracted endpoints for this change>
external_source: ../../external/<original-filename>
decomposition_id: <uuid> (only if multi-change decomposition)
prerequisites: <list of prerequisite change names> (if change has dependencies)
```

The `change-creation` skill will:
1. Create change directory: `specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/`
2. Create SPEC.md with proper frontmatter and extracted content
3. Create PLAN.md with type-appropriate phases and prerequisites section
4. Update INDEX.md with the new change entry (includes type indicator)

See `skills/change-creation/SKILL.md` for detailed specification.

#### Step 5.5: Update shared files

Note: INDEX.md is updated by the `change-creation` skill for each change. This step handles additional updates.

1. **Add External Specifications table to INDEX.md:**
   ```markdown
   ## External Specifications

   | Source | Imported | Changes |
   |--------|----------|---------|
   | [<filename>](external/<filename>) | YYYY-MM-DD | change-1, change-2, ... |
   ```

2. **Update SNAPSHOT.md:**
   - Add summary for each change
   - Extract key capabilities from each

3. **Update domain glossary:**
   - Add shared concepts extracted during decomposition
   - Add change-specific terms with definitions

#### Step 5.6: Display completion summary

```
✓ External spec copied to: specs/external/<original-filename>
✓ Created N change specifications:
  - specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-1/SPEC.md
  - specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-1/PLAN.md
  - specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-2/SPEC.md
  - specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-2/PLAN.md
  ...
✓ Updated INDEX.md, SNAPSHOT.md, and domain glossary

Suggested implementation order: change-1 → change-2 → ...

Next step: Start with the first change:
  /sdd-implement-plan specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/change-1/PLAN.md
```

### Step 6: Initialize git repository

If not already in a git repository:
```bash
cd ${TARGET_DIR} && git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup from spec-driven template"
```

If already in a git repository (current directory case):
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup from spec-driven template"
```

### Step 7: Verify completion and report

After ALL steps are done:

1. List the created structure:
   ```bash
   tree ${TARGET_DIR} -L 3 -I node_modules
   ```

2. Display completion message with customized next steps:

   **If external spec was provided (multi-change decomposition):**
   ```
   ✓ Project initialized: <project-name>
   ✓ Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
   ✓ Description: <project-description>
   ✓ Primary Domain: <primary-domain>
   ✓ Components created: <list of selected components>
   ✓ External spec copied to: specs/external/<original-filename>
   ✓ Created N change specifications from external spec

   Changes created (in suggested implementation order):
     1. change-1 (feature): Brief description
     2. change-2 (feature): Brief description
     ...

   Next steps:
   [If TARGET_DIR is not current directory]
   1. cd <project-name>
   2. npm install --workspaces
   [If TARGET_DIR is current directory]
   1. npm install --workspaces
   3. Review the decomposed changes:
      - specs/external/<original-filename> (original external spec)
      - specs/INDEX.md (lists all changes with links)
      - specs/domain/glossary.md (extracted domain terms)
   4. Start implementing the first change:
      /sdd-implement-plan specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<first-change>/PLAN.md
   5. After completing each change, proceed to the next in order.
   ```

   **If standard initialization (no external spec):**
   ```
   ✓ Project initialized: <project-name>
   ✓ Location: <absolute-path-to-target-dir>
   ✓ Description: <project-description>
   ✓ Primary Domain: <primary-domain>
   ✓ Components created: <list of selected components>

   Next steps:
   [If TARGET_DIR is not current directory]
   1. cd <project-name>
   2. npm install --workspaces
   [If TARGET_DIR is current directory]
   1. npm install --workspaces
   3. cd components/contract && npm run generate:types
   4. Review and customize:
      - specs/domain/glossary.md (add your domain terms)
      - components/contract/openapi.yaml (define your first API)
   5. Create your first change: /sdd-new-change --type feature --name <change-name>
   ```

**DO NOT STOP until you have completed every single step above and verified the structure.**

## Important Notes

- This command will ALWAYS ask for user approval before creating files
- Users can customize which components to include
- All template variables are populated from user-provided information
- Project structure is created atomically (all or nothing)
- **External spec support**: When `--spec` is provided, the external spec is:
  - Copied to `specs/external/<original-filename>` for permanent reference
  - Parsed to extract defaults for project setup
  - **Analyzed for multi-change decomposition** using the `spec-decomposition` skill
  - Decomposed into multiple independent changes (user confirms breakdown)
  - Each change gets its own `specs/changes/YYYY/MM/DD/<change-name>/` directory
  - Changes include SPEC.md and PLAN.md with proper frontmatter
  - Dependencies between changes are tracked and suggested implementation order provided
  - User can merge, split, rename, or change type before creation
  - User can choose [K] to keep as single spec (legacy behavior)
  - Shared domain concepts extracted to glossary
  - This allows incremental implementation of large product requirements

## Template Sources

Templates are colocated with their scaffolding skills:

| Skill | Templates | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `project-scaffolding` | `skills/project-scaffolding/templates/` | Root files, specs, config |
| `backend-scaffolding` | `skills/backend-scaffolding/templates/` | Server component (CMDO) |
| `frontend-scaffolding` | `skills/frontend-scaffolding/templates/` | Webapp component (MVVM) |
| `contract-scaffolding` | `skills/contract-scaffolding/templates/` | OpenAPI contract |

The main `scaffolding` skill orchestrates these component skills.
