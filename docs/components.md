> Reference for all SDD component types.

## Overview

Components are the building blocks of an SDD project. Each component lives under `components/` and is recommended during `/sdd-init` based on your project's needs.

## Available Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `contract` | OpenAPI specification |
| `server` | Node.js backend (CMDO pattern) |
| `webapp` | React frontend (MVVM pattern) |
| `database` | PostgreSQL migrations and seeds |
| `helm` | Kubernetes Helm charts |
| `testing` | Testkube test setup and definitions |
| `cicd` | GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows |

All component types support multiple instances. See [Multi-Instance Components](#multi-instance-components) below.

## Component Details

### Contract

API-first design using OpenAPI specifications. Defines the shared interface between server and client components. Generated TypeScript types ensure type safety across the stack.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/contract/`, `components/contract-task-api/`)

### Server

Node.js/TypeScript backend following the CMDO (Controller, Model, Data, Operator) architecture pattern. Implements the API contract and contains business logic.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/server/`, `components/server-api/`)

### Webapp

React/TypeScript frontend following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. Consumes the API contract for type-safe client calls.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/webapp/`, `components/webapp-admin/`)

### Database

PostgreSQL database component with migrations, seeds, and management scripts. Handles schema evolution and test data.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/database/`, `components/database-analytics/`)

### Config

YAML-based configuration management with validation schemas. Always included in every project. Config lives at `config/` in the project root and is **not** a component.

### Helm

Kubernetes Helm deployment charts and container definitions for production deployment.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/helm/`, `components/helm-services/`)

### Testing

Testkube test setup and definitions for integration and end-to-end testing.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/testing/`, `components/testing-e2e/`)

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment, including PR checks and release pipelines.

**Directory:** `components/<name>/` (e.g., `components/cicd/`, `components/cicd-deploy/`)

## Multi-Instance Components

All component types support multiple instances. Each component is listed in `sdd-settings.yaml` with a `type` and `name`. The directory is always `components/<name>/`. Examples:

- `contract` and `contract-task-api` for separate API contracts
- `server-api` and `server-worker` for separate API and background processing services
- `webapp-admin` and `webapp-public` for separate admin and public-facing interfaces
- `database` and `database-analytics` for separate database schemas

## Dependencies

|-----------|----------|

| Server | Contract |
| Webapp | - |
