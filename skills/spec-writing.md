# Spec Writing Skill

## Templates

Use templates below as starting points.

## Spec Lifecycle

**Git is the state machine:**
- In PR = draft (implicit, no status field needed)
- Merged to main = active
- Explicit statuses only for: `active`, `deprecated`, `superseded`, `archived`

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every spec must include:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
status: active | deprecated | superseded | archived
domain: Identity | Billing | Core | ...
issue: PROJ-1234                    # Required: JIRA/GitHub issue
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
supersedes: [optional, path to old spec]
superseded_by: [optional, path to new spec]
---
```

**Required fields:**
- `title`
- `status`
- `domain`
- `issue` ← Must reference a tracking issue
- `created`
- `updated`

## Validation

Run `scripts/validate-spec.py <path>` to check:
- Required frontmatter fields present (including `issue`)
- Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- All referenced entities exist in domain glossary

## Spec Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Feature specs | `specs/features/<n>/SPEC.md` |
| Domain entities | `specs/domain/entities/<n>.md` |
| API contracts | `specs/architecture/api-contracts.md` |

## Acceptance Criteria Format

Always use Given/When/Then:

```
- [ ] **AC1:** Given [precondition], when [action], then [expected result]
```

## Template: Feature Spec

```markdown
---
title: [Feature Name]
status: active
domain: [Domain Name]
issue: [PROJ-XXX or GitHub issue URL]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
